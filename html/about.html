        <h2 class="start-top title">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there, my name is Jesse! I'm a Computer Science major
          at Montana State University planning to graduate in May 2025.
          I'm currently doing NASA funded research at <a href="https://spacegrant.montana.edu/borealis.html">MSU's BOREALIS lab</a>. 
          My project is <a href="projects/koabc.html">KOABC</a>, 
          which aims to introduce K-12 students to arduino coding through
          a block code website.
        </p>
        <p>I love hiking, baking, and playing video / board games. Many
          years of playing flash games, trying free apps, and admiring websites have led
          me to an interest in software engineering. From this background,
          I have learned that importance of human-centered design, which is
          the central pillar of my design philosophy.

            <p>I've lived in Montana for the majority of my life,
              and it's brought many unique opportunities and challenges.
            For most of my peers and myself, we had limited
            computer access outside of school. This restriction fostered
            passion in web and cloud development for me, to allow the greatest
            accessibility to my applications possible. </p>

          <h1>Work</h1>
          <p>Alongside my current work at the BOREALIS lab, I also worked
            as a teaching aid for a Helena College computer science summer
            camp in the summer of 2022. This job centered around teaching
            middle school students about computer science fundamentals:
            explaining how to code in python, navigate linux terminals,
            and cybersecurity fundamentals. This work required detailed attention
            and explanation to students to ensure their understanding. From this
            experience, I also learned more about each of the topics taught: gaining
            insight on how to explain concepts without jargin and draw parallels to
            common ideas. 
          </p>
          <p>During the summer of 2024, I worked at Costco Wholesale as a frontend
            employee. This work required frequent coordination and communcation with
            coworkers to ensure customer satisfaction. Throughout the summer, I performed
            many different roles throughout the warehouse: assisting cashiers, running carts,
            fixing product presentation, checking customer cards, and making food court orders.
            The breadth of this work taught me to be flexible and continually keep learning new
            things. This is the same as in software engineering, since new technologies are
            constantly being created and updated over time. In addition, the most well rounded
            developers can serve multiple roles on the same project.

          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <p>Through my classes and work experience, I have learned my skills
            useful for software engineering. I am proficient in the programming languages
            Java, Python, and C. I also have some experience in the languages Javascript,
            C#, and Dart. I can create full stack websites with database integration. I
            am also experienced with GitHub and project version management. In addition,
            I have a strong understanding of computer fundamentals and how programming 
            languages work. I can also debug code quickly and efficienty as well, since
            I have worked as a TA for Basic Data Structures and Algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my technical skills, I also have soft skills. I have excellent time
            management skills because my coursework is project based. I am also able to multitask,
            working on multiple projects at the same time with effective organization of each one.
            I work well with other developers, with a variety of my projects being completed with
            partners. I also always push to learn new things, researching novel languages and frameworks.

        <h1>Academic Achievements</h1>
        <p>I graduated from Captial High School in 2022 with the BEAR award as a valedictorian. The <a href="https://chs.helenaschools.org/about/chs-course-registration/course-catalog/information/bear-award/">BEAR award</a> is an achievement given for maintaining a 3.5 throughout highschool, alongside
          taking enough foreign language and honors classes. At MSU, I have kept up this academic track record: currently holding a 4.0. I'm also going to graduate from MSU a year early
          because of the honors, AP, and dual credit courses I took throughout highschool.

        <h1>Congressional App Challenge</h1>
        <p>While I was in highschool, I decided to make an application to teach drivers safety to highschoolers for the Congressional App Challenge. This was because while teenagers take drivers education courses,
          there are many difficult situations that happen on the road that aren't covered in drivers ed. In addition, there are dangerous behaviours like using a phone while driving
          that are common among teens. My app was focused on teaching about these aspects, working as suplemental material to drivers education courses. After making the application, I submitted it
          to the competition and ended up being the <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/21-MT00/">2021 Congressional App Challenge winner</a> for Montana's senatorial district.
