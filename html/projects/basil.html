        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Basil is an applicaiton that helps users improve their relationship
          with social media. This is done by providing resources for users
          to learn about social media, allowing users to set social media use
          goals, and creating a sense of community to keep users engaged.
        </p>

        <p>This project was thought up and developed by Jasmine Hruska and me.

            <p>
              Social media has become an omnipresent facet of everyday life,
              but it can hurt users self image by creating unrealistic
              expectations. It can also turn from a simple passtime to
              an adiction that is hard to break or improve because of designs
              implemented by social media to keep users engaged.
              We designed Basil from based on a question:
              How can we improve user's relationship with social media?

              For the project, we used Adobe Express for digital graphics and 
              iPad Canvas for drawn graphics. When using pictures, we drew from
              Adobe Stock. Creating the high-fidelity prototype was done using
              Adobe XD. Testing of the project was done using the interactive
              prototype we created, with statical analysis being done with Python.
              Lastly, we wrote about the project process using <a href="https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/hY0GHBT5gUjKp">Adobe Express<a>.

            To start the project, we first looked into the issue to
            see if people actually thought it was a problem and where
            the main focus of our application should be. We decided on
            an interview of 5 people between the ages of 17 and 21, with
            3 women and 2 men. From these interviews, we were able to
            create a user persona in relation to important aspects for
            our application:

          <h1>Mind Mapping</h1>
          <p>
            After creating a user persona, we started the brainstorming
            process for our application. We brought back in the people we
            interviewed for the persona, and created a digital mind map
            using Miro. We then condensed the mind map afterwards: combining
            redundant catagories, adding images, and emphasizing key aspects.

              With the key aspects of our application defined by our mind map, we
              were able to begin prototyping. This started with a simple, drawn
              low-fidelity prototype that had screens for each of the features we
              wanted to implemented. After these screens were created, we were able
              to see sub-menus that would also need to be drawn.

                    After creating the low-fidelity prototypes, we began designing our
                    high-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD. This was a difficult step,
                    since Jasmine and I had never used the application. We started by making
                    simple UI elements that we could then reuse throughout the entire
                    prototype until everything was represented. Then, we recreated the
                    screens from our low-fidelity prototype with the elements.

        <h1>Usability Heuristics</h1>
        <p>
          When designing our application, we evaluated the design with
          each of the 10 Usability Heuristics. Doing so elevated our
          prototypes to be more well thought out in advance. Each part
          was implemented into the final result of our applicaiton, with
          special focus on Aesthetic and Minimalist Design with our app
          to avoid overwhelming users. We also had to give attention to 
          Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, since many parts of our app
          could have varying complexity which would also change how easy
          it was to interact with it. In the end, we decided to keep the
          application relatively simple to allow the greatest ease of use.

        <p>
          It has been eye opening for me to see
          so many of my preconceptions be proven wrong through user feedback.
          UI design is very multifaceted, I never realized it could be so
          collaborative before this project. Considering the research, 
          feedback, and results of this project,
          we might continue on to make a working version of this app.
          While it will take more work, the groundwork has been layed out
          to turn this idea into a reality.
